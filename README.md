# lemin

This program is given a textfile that represent a anthill (a set of rooms, linked to each other with tunnels and a number of ant).

In every valid anthill, there is a Start room,a End room, and at least a set of tunnel that link Start to End.

The goal of "Lemin" is to calculate the path(s) that allow a given number of ants to go from Start to end, in the shortest number of turns possible, given that you can't have two ants in the same rooms, or two ants using the same tunnel simultaneously.
